Focusing so much on writing observation test cases and calculation in the lab doesn't really make sense because students aren't really focusing on what they should learn and what scopes they can use of their experiments to perform some additional operations. We are trying to bring a solution that can help to overcome such obstacles of practicing science in a decent manner by:

- Transforming "n" **(1 ≤ n ≤ N)** number of observation test cases into digital format
- Helping to calculate their experiment results through automated system
- Saving time and focusing more on their experiments
- Helping them to understand the opportunities & scopes of what they can do more with their experiments
- Helping them to understand how correct their experiments are going on to find out the nearest error free results by using **K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm**.
